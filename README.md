# Hi there!! I'm Mariam Olatunji

## About Me
I help organizations turn raw, overwhelming data into actionable insights that uncover opportunities, solve problems, and drive strategic growth.

My journey started with a passion for asking questions and spotting patterns others overlook. From analyzing marketing campaigns to uncovering patient care trends in healthcare, I've seen firsthand how data, when translated into insights, can transform decision-making. That "aha!" moment of clarity drives me in every project.

I specialize in simplifying complex data with tools like SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Python to create dashboards, reports, and strategies that leaders actually use. Along the way, I've transformed large, messy datasets into clean, decision-ready reports, built interactive dashboards to track KPIs in real time, and uncovered insights that improved campaign ROI and highlighted efficiency gaps.

Whether in marketing, healthcare, or operations, my focus is always on impact, not just numbers. I'm open to collaborations, knowledge sharing, and opportunities to put data to work.
